-What is the main objective of the repository?
Help Neo with the implementation of SMB2 assets for SFMB.

-You were making the vCarry sprites, what happened?
Due to the constant Fixes that the themes have had, most of the sprites that I had made have been outdated, therefore it would be better to work as a team to present the request correctly.

-What exactly does vCarry consist of?
It is the technique by which Mario can pull buried objects or directly grab enemies. The idea is that unlike SMM, the Vertical Carry is an ability flag instead of just an item, Mario can't stand on normal enemies.

-Could vCarry be applied without having any SMB2 enemies or objects? 
Yes, since there are objects such as POWs, horizontal springs and even NPCs. If everything goes well, some SMB2 elements could be added such as grass, the cursed key, mushroom blocks and buried objects, but that would be later.

-So the idea is to have both carry?
Exactly similar to what happens in SMA4, as a level creator you will have the freedom to choose between the two as you design your level. Maybe you want the player to be able to grab Shyguys and not Galoombas or vicecersa. Another example would be if you want to make a wall of POW blocks but you cannot grab them from the side but you will have to go to the top to be able to remove them.

-I would like to participate, what should I do?
Everyone is invited to participate either by proposing ideas or drawing. It is advisable to work in small groups for each theme, but if you want you can do it alone and share your progress.

What is vCarry made up of?
In principle there are "13 sprites".

° Pull (2 sprites).
° Idle (1 sprite).
° Walk/Run (3 sprites).
° Swim (3 sprites).
° Jump (2 sprites).
° Throw (1 sprite).
° Crouch (1 sprite).

Obviously there will be themes where the animation is smoother and therefore will have more sprites.
-That vCarry thing is very good, but I would like to participate more in the objects and enemies.
As I said before I think we should focus first on the ability flag and once it is ready we will see where all this takes us.
